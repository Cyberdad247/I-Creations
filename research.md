## Sandbox for Real-World Scenarios

The Agent Sandbox will provide an interactive sandbox for testing agents in simulated environments. Pre-defined scenarios will be available (e.g., e-commerce chatbot, coding assistant). It will include browser-based simulations and API endpoints for interaction. The Agent Testing Playground will be enhanced to support sandbox features. Real-world test cases and metrics for performance evaluation will be added. This will be achieved by creating backend services to simulate real-world interactions and integrating them with the frontend for seamless user interaction. API endpoints will allow the frontend and the agents to trigger actions, retrieve information, and receive simulated responses.
