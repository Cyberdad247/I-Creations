# UI Component Hierarchy

## Core Components
1. **Layout Components**
   - AppLayout (main app wrapper)
   - NavBar (current implementation exists)
   - Sidebar (to be implemented)
   - Footer (to be implemented)

2. **UI Elements**
   - Tooltip (current implementation exists)
   - Button (to be implemented)
   - Card (to be implemented)
   - Modal (to be implemented)
   - Form Elements (to be implemented)

3. **Page Components**
   - Dashboard (exists as dashboard.tsx)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Components
1. Create Button component (reusable, styled)
2. Extend Tooltip with additional features
3. Implement Card component for content containers

### Phase 2: Layout Structure
1. Create AppLayout component
2. Implement Sidebar navigation
3. Build Footer component

### Phase 3: Page Components
1. Enhance Dashboard page
2. Create AgentManagement page
3. Build Settings page

Each component will:
- Be under 500 lines
- Include TypeScript interfaces
- Have corresponding unit tests
- Follow existing styling patterns
