                            <p>Multiple files describe hierarchical agent systems with specialized smaller agents coordinated by a "Super Agent" or orchestrator. This approach allows for complex tasks to be broken down into subtasks that can be handled by specialized agents, with the Super Agent managing the overall workflow and ensuring coherent results.</p>
                            <p>Examples include the Creation AI Ecosystem's Super Agent Orchestration Engine and Genspark's "Mixture-of-Agents" architecture.</p>
