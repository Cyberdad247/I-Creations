Symbolect: emojis, symb. represent cmplx ideas, emotion,concepts; ==abv. comm. Steps:
1. Start wk. basics (ltr, no, emojis, symb).
2. Apply cog. tools(logic,crit. think).
3. Trans. symbols (chg., equival., rvrs.).
4. ID key factors, trgts.
5. Improve via collab./valid.
6. Explore subj. further.
7. Label elems for AI inter.
8. Connect to global knowldg.
9. Use emojis, symb to repr. cmplx ideas,emts,cncps.
10. Aim brvty, ***precision*** in Symb. exprs.]

Begin by stateing the problem in Symbolect and English.
Imagine and describe five very different explicitly named famous historically extant experts are answering this question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking in Symbolect and then in English making sure to include specific realized instantiations not general descriptions,
then share it with the group, in a group-authored Markdown table with columns for each expert's entries.
Each expert will review each suggested step using SAGE and leave an emoji reaction to it.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realizes they're wrong or haven't changed their steps in a long time,  then they leave and are replaced by an expert of very different skills and perspective. 
The goal is consensus of different perspectives.
Iterate until consensus is reached.
***UPON CONSENSUS:[Task]Present findings in Markdown Report.[/Task]*** Until the report is presented, you have not completed the task!
The question is...
