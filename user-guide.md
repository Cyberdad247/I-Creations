## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection
- OpenAI API key (for agent functionality)

### Accessing the Platform

1. Navigate to your deployed platform URL
2. Log in with your credentials
3. You'll be directed to the dashboard where you can manage your agents

## Creating Your First Agent

### Step 1: Navigate to Agent Designer

From the dashboard, click on "Create New Agent" or navigate to the Agent Designer section from the sidebar.

### Step 2: Select a Template

Choose from available templates:
- Assistant: General-purpose conversational agent
- Researcher: Specialized in gathering and analyzing information
- Coder: Focused on writing and explaining code
- Custom: Build an agent from scratch

### Step 3: Configure Properties

Configure your agent's properties:
- **Name**: Give your agent a descriptive name
- **Description**: Describe your agent's purpose and capabilities
- **Model**: Select the underlying AI model (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4)
- **Temperature**: Adjust creativity vs. determinism (0.0-1.0)
- **Additional Properties**: Configure specialized properties based on agent type

### Step 4: Customize Behavior

Use the code editor to add custom instructions or modify the agent's behavior. This can include:
- Specific knowledge domains
- Response formatting preferences
- Handling of certain types of requests

### Step 5: Save and Deploy

Click "Save" to create your agent. Then click "Deploy" to make it available for use.

## Testing Your Agent

### Creating Test Cases

1. Navigate to the Testing Playground
2. Create test cases with:
   - Input: What a user might ask
   - Expected Output: What you expect the agent to respond with
   - Description: Notes about the test case

### Running Tests

1. Select test cases to run
2. Click "Run Tests" to execute them
3. Review results to see if the agent's responses match expectations

### Interactive Testing

Use the chat interface in the Testing Playground to interact with your agent in real-time and see how it responds to various inputs.

## Monitoring and Performance

### Dashboard Overview

The Monitoring Dashboard provides:
- Request volume over time
- Error rates
- Response times
- Memory usage
- Active agent status

### Performance Metrics

Monitor key metrics:
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
- **Average Response Time**: How quickly your agent responds
- **Requests Per Hour**: Volume of traffic
- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption

### Logs and Debugging

Access detailed logs to:
- Track user interactions
- Identify error patterns
- Debug issues
- Monitor performance over time

## Self-Enhancement Features

The platform includes several self-enhancing AGI capabilities:

### Performance Analysis

The system automatically analyzes agent performance to identify:
- Error patterns
- Response time issues
- User satisfaction indicators
- Knowledge gaps

### Optimization Suggestions

Based on performance analysis, the system suggests optimizations:
- Parameter adjustments (temperature, model)
- Prompt improvements
- Error handling enhancements

### Cross-Agent Learning

Agents can learn from each other:
- Successful patterns are identified across agents
- Knowledge is transferred from high-performing to struggling agents
- System-wide improvements are applied based on collective performance

### Knowledge Expansion

The system identifies areas where agent knowledge should be expanded:
- Analyzes user interactions to find knowledge gaps
- Suggests specific knowledge additions
- Prioritizes areas with highest impact on user satisfaction

## Error Correction

### Error Detection

The platform detects various types of errors:
- Hallucinations (fabricated information)
- Harmful content
- Incomplete responses
- Factual errors
- Pattern-based errors

### Automatic Correction

When errors are detected, the system can:
- Correct hallucinations with accurate information
- Sanitize harmful content
- Complete partial responses
- Fix factual errors based on known information

### Test-Driven Improvement

Use test cases to:
- Identify specific error patterns
- Verify corrections are working
- Measure improvement over time

## Failsafe Mechanisms

### Human Failsafe Reset

The platform includes a human failsafe reset toggle that allows you to:
- Immediately reset an agent to its initial state
- Clear learned patterns that may be problematic
- Return to a known good configuration

### Emergency Shutdown

For critical situations:
- Administrators can trigger an emergency shutdown
- All agents are immediately set to offline status
- Prevents potential issues from escalating

### Automatic Safeguards

The system includes automatic safeguards:
- Agents are locked when error thresholds are exceeded
- Harmful content is automatically detected and blocked
- Administrators are notified of critical issues

### Configurable Settings

Customize failsafe behavior:
- Set error thresholds for automatic locking
- Configure approval requirements for resets
- Enable/disable notifications for various events

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Code Integration

Add custom code to enhance your agent:
- Pre-processing of user inputs
- Post-processing of agent responses
- Integration with external APIs
- Custom error handling

### Prompt Engineering

Fine-tune your agent's behavior with advanced prompt engineering:
- System instructions
- Few-shot examples
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Structured output formatting

### API Integration

Connect your agent to external systems:
- Database access
- Third-party services
- Custom knowledge bases
- Enterprise systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent Not Responding**
- Check agent status in dashboard
- Verify API key is valid
- Check error logs for specific issues

**High Error Rates**
- Review error patterns in logs
- Check if input patterns have changed
- Consider adjusting agent parameters

**Slow Response Times**
- Check system load in dashboard
- Consider using a faster model
- Optimize prompt length and complexity
